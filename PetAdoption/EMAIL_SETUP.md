# Email Welcome Feature Setup

This guide explains how to set up the email welcome feature for newly registered users.

## Features Added

✅ **Welcome Email**: New users receive a personalized welcome email after successful registration
✅ **Professional Content**: Includes user details and platform information
✅ **Error Handling**: Registration continues even if email fails
✅ **Development Ready**: Mock email configuration for testing

## Email Configuration

### 1. Gmail Setup (Recommended)

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate App Password**:
   - Go to Google Account Settings
   - Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords
   - Generate a new app password for "Mail"
3. **Update Configuration**:
   - Edit `src/main/resources/application.properties`
   - Replace `your-email@gmail.com` with your Gmail address
   - Replace `your-app-password` with the generated app password

### 2. Alternative Email Providers

You can use other SMTP providers by updating the configuration:

```properties
# For Outlook/Hotmail
spring.mail.host=smtp-mail.outlook.com
spring.mail.port=587

# For Yahoo
spring.mail.host=smtp.mail.yahoo.com
spring.mail.port=587

# For Custom SMTP
spring.mail.host=your-smtp-server.com
spring.mail.port=587
```

## Email Content

The welcome email includes:
- 🎉 Personalized greeting with user's name
- 📧 Account details (email, username, role)
- 🐾 Platform features and capabilities
- 📞 Support information
- 🎨 Professional formatting with emojis

## Testing

### Development Mode
- Email debug is enabled for development
- Check console logs for email sending status
- Registration continues even if email fails

### Production Mode
- Set `@Profile("prod")` for production email configuration
- Disable debug mode for security
- Monitor email delivery logs

## Files Modified

### Backend
- ✅ `pom.xml` - Added Spring Boot Mail dependency
- ✅ `EmailService.java` - Email service interface
- ✅ `EmailServiceImpl.java` - Email service implementation
- ✅ `AuthServiceImpl.java` - Integrated email sending in registration
- ✅ `EmailConfig.java` - Email configuration
- ✅ `application.properties` - Email settings

### Frontend
- ✅ No changes needed (email is sent automatically after registration)

## Usage

The feature works automatically:
1. User registers on the frontend
2. Backend processes registration
3. User is saved to database
4. Welcome email is sent automatically
5. User receives confirmation toast

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending
1. Check Gmail app password is correct
2. Verify 2FA is enabled on Gmail
3. Check console logs for error messages
4. Ensure firewall allows SMTP traffic

### Registration Fails
- Email failures don't affect registration
- Check database connection
- Verify JWT configuration

## Security Notes

- ✅ App passwords are more secure than regular passwords
- ✅ Email credentials are in properties file (use environment variables in production)
- ✅ Registration continues even if email fails
- ✅ No sensitive data in email content

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- HTML email templates
- Email verification links
- Password reset emails
- Newsletter subscriptions
- Email preferences in user profile
